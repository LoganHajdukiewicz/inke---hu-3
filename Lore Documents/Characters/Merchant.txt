A defective AI unit. One of Phaethon's prototypes that escaped. When Phaethon 
found out about him escaping, they didn't really care all that much. He sells 
upgrades for GEARs which eats. He goes from a skinny lil robot to a big robot. 
He is defective in almost every way duck tape, cracked eye visor, exposed 
wires, patchwork additions, constantly breaking. Cowardly and stupid. He is 
convinced that he is a human. And nothing can change his mind. 

No matter how many times Inke says he is a human, the Merchant is unphased. He 
still refers to himself as a human.
