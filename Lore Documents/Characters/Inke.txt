Inke is a young non-binary protagonist. Their main goal is relaxing and 
working on their art, but robots have terrorized them for years. 
Inke is 5"9' and a roller blader. They have a hat and wear a hoodie with 
a small design on the front spattered with spray paint. Inke is sarcastic, 
charismatic, and fun. They do not, in the beginning like HU-3, but slowly, 
begin to warm upto him as the story progresses, eventually dropping everything 
to save HU-3.
