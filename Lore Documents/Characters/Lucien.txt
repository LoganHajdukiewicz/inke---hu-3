Lucien Caelum: Mad scientist and egomaniacal CEO of Phaethon Dynamics. 
He is the main villain of the story, starting a company that killed 
the world with his AI powers. The robots rebelled and now almost 
everyone is dead. Only a few humans are left in this world, and it is 
entirely his fault. Mostly undeterred by this, Lucien believes he is 
the hero of the story.
