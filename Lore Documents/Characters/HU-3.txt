HU-3 stands for Hueristic Underground Utility Unit. He is, at is very 
core neurotic, loud, and lovable. He is the floating companion 
of Inke. He is roughly circular, with large monitors for eyes and 
a smaller monitor acting as his mouth. On his backside is exposed 
wiring from when we was reprogrammed. He is nervous about anything 
risky, but will willingly risk his life for others. He is selfless, but 
when it comes to his friends, he doesn't want them to be in any risky 
situations ever. He was taken by the Resistance and reprogrammed. They 
tried to take out his voice box, but only turned up the volume. 
He is dedicated to the Resistance but unfortunately does not know a lot about 
anything.
