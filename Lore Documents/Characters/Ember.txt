Ember is a pyromanic who would kill her own people. She burns bridges 
and burns bridges. She is focused on the outcome of her actions and 
would be an anime protagonist in any other world. She is on fire, 
angry, and is willing to take it out on anyone who is not worthy. 

Her anger comes from Phaethon Industries.
