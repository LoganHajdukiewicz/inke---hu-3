Inke and HU-3 follows the adventures of Inke: a highly 
skilled graffiti artist, and HU-3: a sentient AI robot 
stolen by the Resistance to fight against the megacorporation
known as Phaethon Dynamics. 

Inke and HU-3 are teamed together in the Resistance, a fragmented 
group of Revolutionaries that has differing factions in each zone 
of the world. In the East is The Head of the Resistance where you 
start. You help individuals, fight baddies, explore, and platform 
around until you gain enough CRED for The Head of the Resistance 
to acknowledge that you are competant enough to not immediately die 
when you venture out to stop the evil of Phaethon. Your goal is to 
find and reunite the different leaders of the Resistance, once 
together, now separated, to fight as one against Phaethon Dynamics. 

You go to the South in search of _____________. He lives in an 
abandoned theme park. Upon meeting him you realize he will not take 
you seriously at all. He constantly laughs at your attempts to make 
him work, but you help his people who are in desparate need of a 
leader. You grind the rails of the roller coaster, fight in his 
gladitorial battle arena, and gain his support through showing him 
the innate fun of adventuring. You tell him to travel to the East and 
wait for you there. 

You go to the West in search of _______________. He lives in a desert 
wasteland. Cacti are the only thing that can survive here. There is 
exposed lava, burning everything. This devestation is the biproduct 
that happens when Phaethon Dynamics decided to run their computers 
24/7 for years. The Earth is sick here. You see ____________. He 
punches a robot that he owns, killing it. He lights another on fire. 
He is clearly unstable. He is only swayed by actions, so when Inke 
first approaches, he almost kills them. He loves power and strength. 
He will only help someone who is as strong as him. In any other world 
he would be an angry anime protagonist. He is fire-y and is 100% okay 
culling his robot army to only have the strong serve him. Combat is 
the main focus of this area, killing his weak (actually quite strong 
but he say's they're weak because he's so strong) robots, dodging 
erupting lava, and helping the wacky cast of characters. He fights 
you one on one as his last test before joining you. 

You go to the North in search of _________________. He is a rockstar. 
His world is powered by electricity and he is shockingly vain. His whole 
world revolves around his image and how cool he looks. Always clad in 
leapord print and rocking a long hairdo, he shreds the guitar and looks 
super cool while doing it. He will only join Inke if they can get enough 
support from his followers, so that his reputation would be destroyed if 
he said no to Inke. 

You go back to the East and begin to plan an attack on Phaethon 
Dynamics. During the meeting, the roof crashes in. You are confronted 
by a robot from Phaethon Dynamics. This one is STRONG. TOO strong. 
You hit it over and over again and nothing happens. HU-3 is then 
stolen. Your mission goes from an attack to a rescue mission. Your 
companion for the whole game is stolen and you must get him back. 

Phaethon Dynamic's building is the size of a full hub world. Everything 
here is clean, professional and robotic. Everything is chrome, and robots 
patrol the streets and kill everything on site. Inke slowly makes their 
way up the corporate ladder of a building and rescues HU-3. Once they are 
reunited. It is time to take on Lucien. 

Lucien final boss. Then credits.
