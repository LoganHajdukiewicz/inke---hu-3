Name: Phaethon Industries
Tagline: Rise Beyond

Started by Lucien Caelum, this company takes its name from 
Phaethon, the son of Helios, the god of the Sun. Phaethon believed
that he could control the chariot of the Sun, and in his 
hubris scorched the Earth until Zeus intervened stopping 
the chariot ride. 

Lucien does not see this as a cautionary tale, but as a tragedy. 
To him, Phaethon’s mistake was not arrogance—it was limitation. 
The gods struck him down too soon. To him, Phaethon's only mistake 
was being mortal. The gods struck him down not because he 
flew too high, but because they feared how high he could go.

“Rise Beyond” is etched into every wall and terminal across the 
company. With the power of synthetic intelligence, Lucien seeks to 
transcend humanity’s station—to seize the reins of creation itself 
and to prove that mankind was never meant to crawl beneath the sun, 
but to drive it.
