S-1GN: Oh hey! Wow, you actually stopped to read me—how polite! Most people just barge right through like they’re too good for heartfelt woodland signage. Not you, though. You’ve got that sweet, curious energy. I like that. Anyway, hi! I’m Bunbun. Yes, that Bunbun. Best ever, flower collector, devoted mama’s boy. Every morning I’d hop through this forest delivering dandelions to my mom. She’d ruffle my ears and call me her “brave little fluff,” even though I was afraid of, like, everything—including pinecones. One day she got sick, so I built her this cozy little sanctuary. Right here. Handcrafted it myself. With no thumbs. Think about that. We lived peacefully for years, just the two of us, until outsiders came stomping through like they owned the place. Chopping trees. Scaring squirrels. And I said, “No more.” So I made this place a bit more exclusive. A sanctuary... with boundaries. You understand. You get me. And now here you are, reading my story like a good little camper. Gosh, I hope you were emotionally invested, because—oopsie!—the floor’s gone. Yeah. It started crumbling like, 30 seconds ago. But hey, thanks for being part of my tragic bunny backstory! Say hi to gravity for me, sweetheart.
